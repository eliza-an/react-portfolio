     <p className='para1 para'>A 22 year old front-end web developer located in Manchester, UK! </p>
     
    <p className='para2 para'>In July of 2022 I graduated from University of Manchester with a 2:1 in Politics, Economics and Philosophy and a first in my dissertation. My love for politics was strong, yet I still craved the satifaction of mathematical problem solving and design that I simply could not get from a political career path. At first I thought tutoring maths part time would be a solution to that problem, but soon enough I came to the conclusion that I had to take that leap of faith and try web development.  </p>
    <p className='para3 para'>After frantically searching for ways to pursue my newfound interest in programming, I stumbled across a Web Developement bootcamp, promising to teach me all the skills necessaryto start my career. So that's what I did! After finishing the bootcamp with a 96.7% (A) I was now certain that this is exactly the sector I want have a carrewer in. I honestly cannot wait for my next opportunity to express and develop these skills. </p>
